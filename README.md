You also need to install expo cli on your pc use this command (npm install -g expo-cli)
Now navigate to client folder and install libraries using npm install
Navigate to backend folder and install libraries using npm install

Also check you ip from ipconfig command on cmd and use that in the apiUrl component 

Also import the db and also change the password and user in your db. You can use xamp or any other tool
Now you are all set

open backend and client folder in separate cmd terminals and run npm start
Scan qr code from mobile or attach your mobile with usb cable and press a in cmd where client folder is opened
